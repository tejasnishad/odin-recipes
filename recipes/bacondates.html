        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>2/3 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/3 pound finely ground pork</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper, nutmeg, allspice and ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>4 oz. sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown,
                about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with
                onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat
                mixture per meatball; form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until
                browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</li>
            <li>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving
                dish.</li>
            <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid.</li>
            <li>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.
            </li>
        </ol>
